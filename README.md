Overview ✨
This repository utilizes real-world retail data to generate actionable insights into customer demographics, spending habits, and regional sales trends. The project leverages powerful Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly, and Dash to clean, analyze, and visualize data. Additionally, SQL scripts are used to aggregate and examine key business metrics, ensuring that the insights are accessible in both static and interactive formats.

Python Analysis & Dashboard 🐍
The core analysis is handled by Retail_Analysis.py inside the python folder. Key functionalities include:

- Data Loading & Cleaning  
  - Reads the CSV file (Gyanankur_Retail.csv) and validates expected columns.
  - Converts date and time fields, creates derived metrics (like age groups), and ensures numeric consistency for key metrics like ratings, total amounts, and total purchases.

- Data Aggregation  
  - Groups data by country, customer segment, and more to summarize total sales, purchases, and customer ratings.

- Visualization Generation  
  - Seaborn: Generates a violin plot that shows spending patterns by customer segment and gender.  
  - Plotly: Produces interactive visuals such as:
    - A choropleth map for total sales by country 🌍.
    - A scatter plot displaying age vs. spending with income as a factor.
    - A density heatmap of average purchase amounts by hour and customer segment.
    - A treemap representing the relationship between segments and income.
    - A bar chart ranking the top 12 product brands by average rating.
  
- Interactive Dashboard  
  - Integrates all Plotly figures into a Dash-based dashboard.
  - Embeds the static violin plot image to offer an additional perspective.
  - Run locally to interact with the dashboard in real time.

SQL Analysis 🗄️
Within the sql folder, you'll find scripts to further explore retail performance metrics:

- SQL Script (schema/retails.sql)  
  - Creates the retail_data table and populates it with sample retail data across various categories like Furniture, Technology, and Office Supplies.
  
- Analytical Queries  
  - Subcategory Analysis: Aggregates sales and profits by Category and Sub_Category and calculates the profit margin percentage.
  - Category Analysis: Summarizes overall sales and profit metrics by Category.
  - Overall Metrics: Computes total sales, total profit, and the overall profit margin percentage.
  
- Outputs  
  - Results from the SQL execution are summarized in sql/output/retail_output.md along with a supplemental image for clarity.

Visualizations 🎨
The project produces a rich variety of visualizations:
- Violin Plot: Displays gender-based spending patterns across customer segments.
- Choropleth Map: Visualizes regional total sales.
- Scatter Plot: Connects customer age and spending, with income differentiation.
- Density Heatmap: Shows average purchases distributed by hour and customer segment.
- Treemap: Explores spending distribution based on customer segments and income levels.
- Bar Chart: Illustrates the top product brands by average ratings.

These images are available in the python/outputs/ folder and are integrated into the live dashboard for an interactive exploration.

Requirements 🛠️
Install the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file located in the main repository folder. To set up your environment, run:

`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

This file lists all necessary dependencies, including pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly, and Dash.

Usage 💻

Running the Python Analysis & Dashboard
1. Navigate to the Python folder:
   `bash
   cd python
   `
2. Run the analysis script:
   `bash
   python Retail_Analysis.py
   `
3. Access the Dashboard:
   - The script will launch a Dash server.
   - Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8050 to interact with the dashboard.

Running the SQL Analysis
1. Load the SQL Script:
   - Open sql/schema/retails.sql in your preferred SQL environment.
2. Execute the Script:
   - Run the commands to create tables, insert data, and perform aggregations.
3. Review the Results:
   - Results are documented in sql/output/retail_output.md with relevant charts and outputs.
